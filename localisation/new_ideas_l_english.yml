 first_national_catastrophe_desc:0 "After the War of Secession ended with the Treaty of Washington being ratified on the 10th of November, we experienced a time of prosperity and pride as we had never failed to come out on top of our enemies, be them the Yankees, the Hawaiian natives, or the Hispanics who revolted in 1898. Now we have seen defeat, the Confederate populace is rowdy and demands the Yankees' blood. Forwards, men! To Philadelphia and death to the Yankee scum!"

 the_new_dixie_desc:0 "After the August 1922 coup by William Simmons and his Liberty League, Dixie has undergone a period of change never seen before. With the restructuring of the hierarchy, industrialisation of states like Alabama and Florida, the South is experiencing a time of stability not seen for decades. Our economy is prospering, the people are happy, and we continue to find allies on the world stage, with Jacques Doriot promising to bring back the alliance of 1867 after he gains power in France."
 treaty_of_charlotte:0 "The Treaty of Charlotte"
 treaty_of_charlotte_desc:0 "The Treaty of Charlotte put paid to our chances of winning the Great War. With so many restrictions, we have been forced to continue rebuilding our military in secret, for fear of the Yanks coming to attack and destroy us. We have been cheated out a lot of basic military needs, including an army larger thant 150,000 men, an airforce, submarines, and even tank divisions. However, this will only make the Yankees fear us more when we march from Nashville to Richmond."
 industrialised_slavery:0 "Industrialised Slavery"
 industrialised_slavery_desc:0 "After Simmons came to power in August 1922, he brought back the practice of slavery, but instead of working the blacks in the fields, he decided to use them as free factory labour. As a result of this change of policy, our industrialisation has been far quicker and our speed of producing goods is quicker. Whilst some would see this as brutal, we see it as putting the lower race back into their correct position as subordinates to the white man."
 aristocratic_high_command:0 "Aristocratic High Command"
 aristocratic_high_command_desc:0 "Whilst Simmons has managed to purge aristocratic influence from most places, the one place where his programme hasn't worked is the Confederate Army. Incompetent aristocratic officers hold high positions of power, and they are unwilling to change military strategy in the name of "honour". As such, our army is not ready for war and we must purge these influences, lest they become so great that we cannot contain them. "
