Not long after, his father died of cancer, and he ascended to the Throne of Washington. Upon his coronation, he took the name "George II" highlighting his connection with the Washingtons of old. Now that a new Second North American War seems to be brewing, nobody knows if the new George II will be better than his father, and reclaim lost Virginian lands. "
 harry_haywood_desc:0 "Harry Haywood. No name is more synonymous with the January revolution, being the main driving force behind it and the one who championed the cause against the whites. Born in Tennessee, he was born into a slave family. His father was a communard resistance fighter, and this led Haywood to become radicalised from a young age. After the Nashville massacre, in which black protesters were gunned down by Confederate National Guard, he joined his father in the NALF, or New Afrika Liberation front. He rose through the ranks, famous for his leadership and oral skills. In 1920, he was the one who stormed into Nashville and proclaimed the Socialist Republic of New Afrika. He fought extensively with his troops, commanding the siege of Montgomery and the 2nd Battle of Atlanta. When the Confederacy finally crumbled, he was the man who was one step ahead of Martin King to seize power for communism, rather than allow democracy. But voices against Haywood are rising. His failure in the eyes of many New Afrikans to stay true to the principles of the revolution has caused a lot of support for the democrats and Martin King. Haywood must do something, or else the nation could fall into a second civil war."
