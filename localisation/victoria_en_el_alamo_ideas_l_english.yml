 the_founding_fathers_fsa_desc:0 "Grant, Lincoln and Sherman. These 3 giants are our founders, ever since we seceded from the relic that was the United States of America 85 years ago. When Lincoln and his Republicans proclaimed the Free States, Sherman and Grant rose to defend it, decisively defeating General George McClellan at Greensburg. When they wrote our Constitution, they loudly proclaimed that the new Free States would be a place of tolerance for all, no matter your religion or race. We hold these men up as titans of democracy, and we must not shame them."

Even though 85 years may have passed, our principles are still the same. All forms of inequality are a moral evil, and we are stronger together no matter your race or creed. We must forever move forwards, lest we fall into recession."

 battlefield_america_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the United States in 1851, the territory it once held has seen conflict and death on a scale not seen since the colonisation of the Americas. Because of this, our military must always be prepared to defend the Free States from oppression, no matter the cost. If we wish to survive the 2nd American War we must make sure that our military is top-notch to defend the nation. "
