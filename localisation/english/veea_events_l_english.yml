 mexico.1001.d:0 "We have horrifiying news coming in from Tegucigalpa:\ there has been a terrorist attack in the city. \n\n\By reports, it had been a normal morning; people were walking to school and work, the market stalls in the main square were packed with shoppers, and the 8 o'clock train was pulling into the station. Suddenly, at 8:19 AM, a bomb exploded in the 8 o'clock train, causing a huge explosion. Survivor's rushed out of the now burning building, while sirens screamed in the nearby firehouse. By 9, the fire had been quelled, and the devastation was now on full display. The station was ruined; burned and caved in by the explosion, which will cause major delay in the coming days. While the true death toll isn't known quite yet, firemen and paramedics have identified 137 bodies, of both young and old."
