Most social conservatives greatly adhere to religious and traditional values as vital to democracy and society as a whole."
 market_liberalism:0 "Market Liberalism"
 market_liberalism_type_desc:0 "A variant of liberalism based on a powerful support and protection of a market economy, natural and private property rights as well as a political system that is democratic in nature. As a political and economic ideology, Market Liberalism focuses on the idea that in an environment of economic laissez-faire, a spontaneous order or 'the invisible hand of the market' emerges that benefits society. Though, it is not necessarily opposed to the provision of a few basic public goods by the state that the market is thought to not being able to provide. Furthermore, Market Liberalism stresses the social contract, under which citizens make the laws and agree to abide by those laws. It is based on the belief that individuals know best what is best for them."
 social_liberalism:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_liberalism_type_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil liberties as basic human rights. Espousing progressive social and economic policies, the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of status. Social Liberalism stresses the social contract, under which citizens make the laws and agree to abide by those laws. It is based on the belief that individuals know best what is best for them. In theory Social Liberalism enfranchises all adult citizens regardless of sex, race, or economic status. Furthermore this 'social contract theory' has over time been elaborated to justify the need for democracy among 'liberals'. Additionally, it also highlights that if a government fails to uphold the promises it made to "the governed," then the populace has the right and the duty to revolt with the purpose of imposing a new government, though as with any ideology there is little agreement among Social Liberal on what these promises are. Generally, they are skeptical of any revolution which is not carried out to achieve the values of Social Liberalism. It generally supports a free-market capitalist economy, albeit with a few regulations."

 liberal_conservatism_type_desc:0 "Liberal Conservatism is a term describing a fusion of more classically liberal ideals with a conservative stance, valuing individuality as well as the society and nation. While in general they tend to be laissez-faire when it comes to capitalism, they are still highly skeptical of social change, with reforms only being considered if they seem truly necessary. Liberal conservatism also highly values the rule of law, with constitutions, institutions, and statutes being seen as irrevocable, eschewing violent and extreme means of gaining power or changing in favor of keeping the state stable."
 national_socialism:0 "National Socialism"
 national_socialism_desc:0 "National Socialism, also known as Nazism or Strasserism, is a radical, ultranationalist, anti-capitalist ideology that is hostile to Jews not only from a racial, cultural, or religious perspective, but also from an economic antisemite basis and seeks to achieve a national rebirth. It derives its name from Gregor and Otto Strasser, two brothers initially associated with this position with its racial aspects, centering around social Darwinism, eugenics, and Pan-Germanism, being attributed to Josef Goebbels. This populist form of economic antisemitism holds notions of class conflict, wealth redistribution, ultranationalism, the break-up of large estates, the development of something akin to a guild system, and the related establishment of a Reich cooperative chamber to take a leading role in economic planning. It strongly adheres to the Führerprinzip, in which the Führer's word is above all written law and that governmental policies, decisions, and offices ought to work toward the realization of this end. It rejects liberalism, communism, capitalism, and homosexuality as "degenerate" in favor of a corporatist form of economy. It can be best described as a reactionary modernist movement, which involves the mixture of great enthusiasm for modern technology and science with a rejection of the Enlightenment and the values and institutions of liberal democracy."
 fiscal_conservatism:0 "Fiscal Conservatism"
 fiscal_conservatism_type_desc:0 "Fiscal Conservatism is a free-market variant of Conservatism that aims to reduce government debt by reducing public spending and avoiding deficit spending. In theory, this can also be accomplished by increasing taxes. However, its adherents would prefer to decrease spending. It advocates for tax cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, deregulation, privatization, free trade, and minimal government debt, combined with support for traditional values and democratic principles."
 national_conservatism:0 "National Conservatism"
 national_conservatism_type_desc:0 "National Conservatism is used to describe nationalist groups that advocate for their national interest first and foremost, with preserving a perceived social status quo or ideals being their chief other concern. National Conservatives can espouse support for democracy or parliamentarianism, but often view the national interest as something that supersedes the rights of its citizens. Some adherents of this ideology tend to hold isolationist, anti-immigrant beliefs."
 rightwing_populism:0 "Right-Wing Populism"
 rightwing_populism_type_desc:0 "Right-Wing Populism is a political ideology which combines right-wing politics and populist rhetoric and themes. Like left-wing populism, it employs anti-elitist sentiments, opposition to the Establishment, and speaking to or for the "common people". However, populists of the right generally focus on cultural issues, often aim to defend a national culture and identity against perceived attacks by outsiders, whereas left-wing populists more frequently employ economic arguments and attack the lack of healthcare and the role of large corporations in society. Adherents tend to fall prey to conspiracy theories and, in some cases, racism."
 national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
 national_liberalism_type_desc:0 "National Liberalism is a variant of liberalism, combining liberal policies and issues with elements of nationalism. At their origin, National Liberals, although pro-business, were not necessarily advocates of free trade and economic liberalism per se and sometimes they favour cooperation between the government and the national industry, moderate levels of protectionism, the establishment of preferential custom unions, subsidies for infant industry or companies considered of national strategic importance and various forms of industrial planning."
