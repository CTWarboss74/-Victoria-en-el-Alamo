 the_founding_fathers_fsa_desc:0 "Grant, Lincoln and Sherman.These men were the ones who rose to defend democracy in the chaos of the American Civil War, as the territories that once held the United States suddenly exploded into violence and death unseen since Columbus first set foot on American soil. When the authoritarian armies marched to Chicago, these men, these titans of democracy, stood in their way and said: "You will not pass. You will not snuff out democracy, not after four score years of peace." They decisively defeated McClellan just outside of Chicago, and the military junta that headed the remnants of the United States could only watch as they were pushed back into the pages of history. These three men, these happy few, are our Fathers. They will not fall, nor will the Free States! Ex deo libertas! "

Our glorious nation preaches a message of tolerance, tolerance for all, no matter the the creed, colour or name. We defend liberalism wherever it might be in need of defence, on every continent and every nation. Standing with our allies in Boston and our friends in London and New Liverpool, we will defend our ideals, no matter the cost. We hold ourselves to God and say: "We are your children. We are your chosen people, the defenders of God and democracy." "

 battlefield_america_desc:0 "Since the American Civil War, the old territories of the United States of America have been ravaged by war and bloodshed, comparable to that of Europe. Throughout this time, the military of the Free States of America has come out on top, defending democracy and the nation no matter the cost. We won the Great North American War with our fighting spirit, earning us the nickname "The Prussia of the Americas". No statement could be more true. On the fropnts of the Roanoke and Tennessee, the Confederates and the Virginians were beaten back by our boys in blue, saying "Forwards, boys! For the Free States!" "

During the Revolution of 1925, Mexico City was at risk of being captured by §YSalvador II's§! forces. Out of despair, Empress Maria Josepha declared the foundation of EUMDM in order to combat Salvador's forces. Many militiamen signed up, under the wing of their ideology. These militias, which ranged from the Communist's Milicia popular, to the Fascist's Brigada de Blackcoat, to even the Liberal's Fuerza Paramilitar Liberal, managed to drive Luis's forces back to Guadalajara, but this wasn't the end of the EUMDM. The men that headed the EUMDM threatened to march into Mexico City unless the EUMDM was kept and given more power. With Mexico weak, Josepha had no way to object. It has been almost 11 years since the EUMDM was founded, and since Mexico had stabilized, the Empress has begun to systematically strip the rights of the EUMDM away. By the looks of it, it won't be much longer until it no longer exsists."

Millions sunk into poverty and lost their jobs because of this monumental collapse. With the UK being one of the biggest economies of that time, it was felt worldwide. Bonar Law and his government floundered as a result, and the Labour Party popularity skyrocketed. Even through reforms from the Mosley administration, the economy is still in shambles, allowing other nations, Germany in particular, to match the might of Britain and her Empire."

 ENG_crippled_royal_navy_4_desc:0 "With the London Stock Market Crash came the budget cuts, and the navy was hit hard by these cuts. Half of their annual budget vanished overnight, causing many of the ships being built to be halted, and many other in-service to be sent to the scrapyards. Then came the strikes. The navy no longer had enough money to pay the seamen their fair share, and most seamen reported their pay being decreased by 2 thirds. These strikes culminated in a fourth of the seamen leaving the navy or being discharged. Even through the reforms the Mosley administration has achived, the navy has seen little money being allocated to them, leaving the navy weak."
