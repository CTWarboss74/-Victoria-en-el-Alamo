 first_national_catastrophe_desc:0 "After the War of Secession ended with the Treaty of Washington being ratified on the 10th of November, we experienced a time of prosperity and pride as we had never failed to come out on top of our enemies, be them the Yankees, the Hawaiian natives, or the Hispanics who revolted in 1898. Now we have seen defeat, the Confederate populace is rowdy and demands the Yankees' blood. Forwards, men! To Philadelphia and death to the Yankee scum!"
 the_new_dixie:0 "The New Dixie"
 the_new_dixie_desc:0 "After the August 1922 coup by William Simmons and his Liberty League, Dixie has undergone a period of change never seen before. With the restructuring of the hierarchy, industrialisation of states like Alabama and Florida, the South is experiencing a time of stability not seen for decades. Our economy is prospering, the people are happy, and we continue to find allies on the world stage, with Jacques Doriot promising to bring back the alliance of 1867 after he gains power in France."
 treaty_of_charlotte:0 "The Treaty of Charlotte"
 treaty_of_charlotte_desc:0 "The Treaty of Charlotte put paid to our chances of winning the Great War. With so many restrictions, we have been forced to continue rebuilding our military in secret, for fear of the Yanks coming to attack and destroy us. We have been cheated out a lot of basic military needs, including an army larger thant 150,000 men, an airforce, submarines, and even tank divisions. However, this will only make the Yankees fear us more when we march from Nashville to Richmond."
 industrialised_slavery:0 "Industrialised Slavery"
 industrialised_slavery_desc:0 "After Simmons came to power in August 1922, he brought back the practice of slavery, but instead of working the blacks in the fields, he decided to use them as free factory labour. As a result of this change of policy, our industrialisation has been far quicker and our speed of producing goods is quicker. Whilst some would see this as brutal, we see it as putting the lower race back into their correct position as subordinates to the white man."
 aristocratic_high_command:0 "Aristocratic High Command"
 aristocratic_high_command_desc:0 "Whilst Simmons has managed to purge aristocratic influence from most places, the one place where his programme hasn't worked is the Confederate Army. Incompetent aristocratic officers hold high positions of power, and they are unwilling to change military strategy in the name of "honour". As such, our army is not ready for war and we must purge these influences, lest they become so great that we cannot contain them. "
 Unstable_country:0 "Unstable country"
 Unstable_country_desc:0 "The Revolution may have been over for more than a decade, but the scars still very much show, from the violence by the KKK to the political gridlock in Mobile. Many areas of the country still lie in ruin from sieges and fighting. In fact, the majority of Memphis is completely rubble, burnt to the ground by retreating Confederates. The people live in squalor, many days being a hunt for basic things like food, medicine and shelter. Whilst there have been some programmes to help post-war New Afrika, many have been unsuccessful, leading many people to either head for the Free States or support other political factions. If something is not done, we could leave the nation in a worse place than we found it."
 internal_factions:0 "Internal factions"
 internal_factions_desc:0 "When the Revolution was proclaimed in Nashville, we negroes stuck together, not because of ideology, but because we had the same colour of skin. Democrats fought alongside communists, not as enemies, but as blood brothers. Now, 15 years after the Revolution's close, those ideological differences are beginning to rear their ugly heads. The New Afrikan nation is split down the middle between communard and anti-communard lines, with Martin King championing the democratic course for the nation, proclaiming "The Communards betrayed the Revolution!". If we are not careful, this could lead us down the path of civil war."
 the_white_menace:0 "The white menace"
 the_white_menace_desc:0 "Whilst many whites fled the nation for the FSA or Kingdom of Virginia, not all of them left, many vowing to carry the torch that the Confederacy dropped. The forces of the KKK, or Klu Klux Klan, still wage guerrilla warfare against the Afrikan government, and some areas in rural Alabama and Mississippi are completely uncontrollable, with ambushes and gunfights being the norm. This has become a major political sore for our nation, with news of atrocities and massacres leaking out of these areas. Whilst New Afrikan ground troops have been fighting with everything they have, they are losing badly, and something must happen, or else we may witness a return to the old ways of the CSA. "
 red_militias:0 "Red militias"
 red_militias_desc:0 "The forces that championed the Revolution were mainly militia, using guerrilla tactics against the Confederate forces. They won the Revolution through ambushes and choke points, not through proper warfare. After the war, Haywood attempted reforms, but they were not possible due to the wide amount of backlash from the army which threatened a coup. As such, these reforms have been put on hold. This does not help the New Afrikan nation in any sense. The army is unprepared, disorganised, and totally unequipped to fight a second North American War. With this war clearly on the horizon, with the victorious Free States gearing up as well, some reforms must happen, or else we may see a second defeat."
